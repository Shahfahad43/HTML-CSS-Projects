          <h2>Founder Of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b>, widely known as
            <b>Quaid-e-Azam</b> (meaning "<b>Great Leader</b>"), was the
            founding father of Pakistan and a pivotal figure in South Asian
            history. Born on <b>December 25, 1876, in Karachi</b>, then part of
            British India, Jinnah was educated at the
            <b>Sindh Madrasa-tul-Islam</b>, followed by further studies in law
            at Lincoln’s Inn in London. He began his political career with the
            <b>Indian National Congress</b> in the early 20th century but grew
            disillusioned with its increasingly Hindu-majoritarian orientation.
            By <b>1913</b>, he joined the <b> All-India Muslim League</b>,
            becoming its most prominent leader and chief architect of the
            <b>Two-Nation Theory</b>, which held that Muslims and Hindus were
            distinct nations, each deserving of its own state. His leadership
            and legal acumen enabled him to negotiate effectively with the
            British and Indian National Congress, culminating in the partition
            of India and the creation of Pakistan on <b>August 14, 1947</b>.
            Jinnah served as Pakistan’s first <b>Governor-General </b> until his
            death on <b>September 11, 1948</b>. Known for his secular vision,
            insistence on rule of law, and commitment to democratic principles,
            Jinnah’s speeches—such as his landmark
            <b>August 11, 1947</b> address to the Constituent
            Assembly—emphasized religious freedom, minority rights, and the
            separation of religion from the state. Despite deteriorating health
            due to tuberculosis and lung cancer, he continued to work tirelessly
            for the nascent nation. Today, he remains a revered figure in
            Pakistan and is often described as one of the most influential
            leaders of the 20th century.
